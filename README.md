🔍 Observed Detections

Suspicious execution of whoami.exe
Executable dropped in Windows root directory
Abnormal Command Prompt parent process
PowerShell execution monitoring
Application Compatibility Database activity
Several alerts triggered at Level 12 (High Severity).

This confirms:
Proper rule decoding
Command-line visibility
Parent-child process tracking
Suspicious behavior detection

✅ Week 1 Status: COMPLETED

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 📅 Week 2 -- Detection Rules (The Logic)

## 🔍 File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

-   Monitored critical directories (/etc)
-   Detected unauthorized modifications
-   Generated real-time alerts

Configured FIM (syscheck) to monitor sensitive directories in real-time.

Configuration includes: - check_all="yes" - realtime="yes"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🐧 Ubuntu FIM Testing

### Test Performed

-   Created a test script file in monitored directory.
-   Modified the file manually.
-   Observed real-time alert generation.

File location:
/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf

Inside <syscheck> section, the following configuration was added:

<directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/etc/passwd</directories>
<directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/etc/shadow</directories>
<directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/etc/group</directories>

<directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/etc</directories>
<directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/usr/bin</directories>
<directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/bin</directories>

After updating configuration:
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent

![](screenshots/ubuntu-fim-script.png)

### Result

Test command used:
sudo nano /etc/passwd

Result:
- File modified alert triggered
- Integrity checksum changed
- Real-time detection confirmed

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚨 Vulnerability Detection

Enabled the Vulnerability Detector module.

### Configuration

-   Canonical provider enabled (Ubuntu)
-   MSU provider enabled (Windows)
-   Automatic CVE database updates configured
-   Periodic scanning enabled


### Capabilities Achieved
-   Detects installed vulnerable packages
-   Maps software versions to CVE database
-   Displays:
    -   CVE ID
    -   Severity Level
    -   Affected Package
    -   Fixed Version
```xml
<enabled>no</enabled>            -->          <enabled>yes</enabled>
```
same for windows & ubuntu OS 

![](screenshots/vuln-detector.png)

then manually  installed vulnerable software.
we used apache2.
Vulnerabilities detected and alerted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚪 Gate Check

✔ Manually modified a file in a monitored FIM directory.\
✔ High-severity alert appeared in dashboard within seconds.\
✔ Vulnerability Detector successfully enabled.\

✅ Week 2 Status: COMPLETED

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 3 – Active Response (Intrusion Prevention System)


🎯 Objective

To configure and verify an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) using Wazuh. The goal is to detect an SSH brute-force attack and automatically trigger a firewall block on the target host (ubuntu_22) to mitigate the threat in real-time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔍 Configuration Details
The active response was configured on the Wazuh Manager in the /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf file.

![](screenshots/ar-conf.png)

⚙️ Active Response Setup
The following parameters were defined to ensure the manager commands the agent to drop malicious traffic:

Command: firewall-drop (utilizes the host's local firewall to block IPs).

Location: local (executes the response on the specific agent that generated the alert).

Timeout: 600 seconds (the IP is unbanned automatically after 10 minutes).

Targeted Rule IDs
To catch the brute force attack effectively, the following rules were monitored:

5760: SSHD authentication failed.

5758: Maximum authentication attempts exceeded.

40111: Multiple authentication failures (Trigger Rule).

2502: Syslog: User missed the password more than once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


🧪 Attack Simulation & Verification 
An SSH brute-force attack was simulated using Hydra against the Ubuntu SSH service.

$ hydra -l root -P passwords.txt ssh://agent-ip

![](screenshots/brute-force.png)

## 🚪 Gate Check

Manual Verification on Target Host
To confirm the IPS worked at the system level, the following checks were performed on the ubuntu_22 agent:

A. Active Response Logs
Verified that the script executed successfully by checking the agent's local log:

$ tail -n 5 /var/ossec/logs/active-responses.log

![](screenshots/ar-log.png) 

Result: The log confirmed the firewall-drop.sh script was called with the add argument for the attacker's IP.

B. Firewall Rules (iptables)
Verified that the IP was added to the kernel routing table:

$ sudo iptables -L -n

![](screenshots/ar-iptable.png)

Result: Confirmed a DROP rule in the INPUT chain for the attacker's source IP.

Output:

DROP  all  --  10.41.55.89       0.0.0.0/0


C. SSH brute-force alerts observed in Wazuh Dashboard
Active Response event logged:
“Host Blocked by firewall-drop Active Response”
![](screenshots/ar-block-event.png)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned

XML Formatting: Initially, the configuration was placed inside XML comment tags (``), causing it to be ignored by the manager. Removing these tags and restarting the wazuh-manager service resolved the issue.


Higher-level rules (e.g., Level 10) are effective triggers for IPS behavior
Wazuh can function as an automated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

Accurate rule selection is critical for proper response execution


🚀 Result

Successfully implemented automated SSH brute-force mitigation using Wazuh Active Response.
