✅ Week 2 Status: COMPLETED

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Week 3 – Active Response (Intrusion Prevention System)


# 🎯 Objective

To configure and verify an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) using Wazuh. The goal is to detect an SSH brute-force attack and automatically trigger a firewall block on the target host (ubuntu_22) to mitigate the threat in real-time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔍 Configuration Details
The active response was configured on the Wazuh Manager in the /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf file.

![](screenshots/ar-conf.png)

# ⚙️ Active Response Setup
The following parameters were defined to ensure the manager commands the agent to drop malicious traffic:

Command: firewall-drop (utilizes the host's local firewall to block IPs).

Location: local (executes the response on the specific agent that generated the alert).

Timeout: 600 seconds (the IP is unbanned automatically after 10 minutes).

Targeted Rule IDs
To catch the brute force attack effectively, the following rules were monitored:

5760: SSHD authentication failed.

5758: Maximum authentication attempts exceeded.

40111: Multiple authentication failures (Trigger Rule).

2502: Syslog: User missed the password more than once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 🧪 Attack Simulation & Verification 
An SSH brute-force attack was simulated using Hydra against the Ubuntu SSH service.

$ hydra -l root -P passwords.txt ssh://agent-ip

![](screenshots/brute-force.png)

## 🚪 Gate Check

Manual Verification on Target Host
To confirm the IPS worked at the system level, the following checks were performed on the ubuntu_22 agent:

A. Active Response Logs
Verified that the script executed successfully by checking the agent's local log:

$ tail -n 5 /var/ossec/logs/active-responses.log

![](screenshots/ar-log.png) 

Result: The log confirmed the firewall-drop.sh script was called with the add argument for the attacker's IP.

B. Firewall Rules (iptables)
Verified that the IP was added to the kernel routing table:

$ sudo iptables -L -n

![](screenshots/ar-iptable.png)

Result: Confirmed a DROP rule in the INPUT chain for the attacker's source IP.

Output:

DROP  all  --  10.41.55.89       0.0.0.0/0


C. SSH brute-force alerts observed in Wazuh Dashboard
Active Response event logged:
“Host Blocked by firewall-drop Active Response”
![](screenshots/ar-block-event.png)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧠 Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned

XML Formatting: Initially, the configuration was placed inside XML comment tags (``), causing it to be ignored by the manager. Removing these tags and restarting the wazuh-manager service resolved the issue.


Higher-level rules (e.g., Level 10) are effective triggers for IPS behavior
Wazuh can function as an automated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

Accurate rule selection is critical for proper response execution


# 🚀 Result

Successfully implemented automated SSH brute-force mitigation using Wazuh Active Response.

Week 3: ✅ Completed

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Challenges Faced ⚠ 
1. SSL/TLS Secure Channel Error
Issue:
While downloading Atomic Red Team from GitHub
Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel

Root Cause:
Older Windows Server versions do not enable TLS 1.2 by default.

Solution Applied:
Enabled TLS 1.2 to resolve secure channel error while downloading Atomic Red Team from GitHub

✔ Successfully resolved GitHub download issue.

2. Initial Incorrect MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Issue:
After executing T1490, alert was generated in Wazuh but mapped to:
T1059.003 (Windows Command Shell)

Instead of:
T1490 (Inhibit System Recovery)

Root Cause:
Default Wazuh rule matched generic command execution before specific behavior.

Solution:
Created custom rule matching:

vssadmin.exe
delete shadows

Mapped rule explicitly to MITRE T1490

Restarted Wazuh Manager

Re-ran simulation

✔ Alert correctly mapped to Impact tactic.

3. Understanding Prerequisites for Shadow Copy Deletion

Issue:
T1490 test requires an existing shadow copy.

If no shadow copy exists, command may return:
No items found that satisfy the query.

Solution:
Manually created shadow copy before executing attack

✔ Ensured realistic ransomware simulation.

### 🏁 Final Conclusion

This SOC lab successfully demonstrated enterprise-level detection engineering, automated response, vulnerability management, and ransomware behavior simulation aligned with MITRE ATT&CK. The environment replicates real-world SOC workflows including monitoring, detection, mitigation, and visualization.
